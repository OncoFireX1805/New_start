## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

We have recived, TSV datafile from supercomputer and now we are going to perform 
First install all the required packages to run 

```{r cars}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r cars}
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
library(tximport)
library(DESeq2)
library(readr)

```

list all the files, salmon function not required here already have in tsv 
```{r}
countData<-read_tsv("C:/Users/parth/OneDrive/Desktop/New_start/rsem.merged.gene_counts.tsv")
View(countData
     )

    
```

We first create a matrix out of the fataset 
```{r}
# Assuming the first column contains gene IDs
geneIDs <- countData[[1]]
counts <- countData[,-1]  # Remove the gene ID column

# Convert to a matrix
countMatrix <- as.matrix(counts)
rownames(countMatrix) <- geneIDs
colnames(countMatrix)


```

A metadata dataframe is prepared 
```{r}
dim(countData)
```


```{r}
sample_names <- colnames(countMatrix)
num_samples <- length(sample_names)
conditions <- factor(c("M10", "M11", "M12", "M3", "M5"))

sampleinfo <- data.frame(
    condition = conditions,
    row.names = sample_names
)
sd
```
